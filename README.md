# Javasript Psychic-Game

The Psychic Game App randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

The app loads with "Guess what letter I'm thinking of" displayed on the main page.

Rules for the Game: 
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. These will display until the user either wins or loses.)
When the player wins, Wins counter increases and game starts over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, Loss counter increases and game restarts without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
